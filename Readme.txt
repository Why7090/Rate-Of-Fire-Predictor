#Installation Requirements:

This was compiled to target the FTD 2.4.3.2 version, which is currently the steam DevTest version, whose C# framework is 4.6.
This version does not depend on any other mod.

It may be incompatible with ProtecTechTools.


#Description:

This mod adds UI elements to each autoloader allowing them to predict what rates of fire your autoloader system can support.

The In-UI rate of fire predictors will only be accurate if all autoloaders are roughly of the same configuration, and use shells of similar lengths to one another. However, even in cases where it is not totally accurate, this tool can still allow you to better estimate what rate of fire your gun might be capable of supporting without forcing you to look at spreadsheets.
